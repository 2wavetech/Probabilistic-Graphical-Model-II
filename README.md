# Probabilistic-Graphical-Model-II: Inference
## Belief Propagation algorithm
We will explore **clique tree** message passing in this assignment, and by its end, will
have created an **inference engine** powerful enough to handle **probabilistic queries** and find **MAP**
assignments over the genetic inheritance networks from the second programming assignment and
the OCR networks from the third programming assignment, respectively. Here are the steps:
1. Clique Tree Construction
2. Message Passing in a Clique Tree
    1. Message Ordering
    2. Sum-Product Message Passing
    3. Max-Sum Message Passing
